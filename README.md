### Hello world :wave:

I'm Hugo Gruson \[[*ygo gʁyzɔ̃*](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=ygo%20g%CA%81yz%C9%94%CC%83&voice=Celine)\]. I'm primarily an Evolutionary Biologist but I fell in love with R and package development during my PhD. I am now a Research Software Engineer in Epidemiology and I can enjoy building tools to facilitate research of others.

I'm particularly proud about the following R packages I'm maintaining or I've helped build:

- [pavo](https://github.com/rmaia/pavo)*: Perceptual Analysis, Visualization and Organization of
    Spectral Colour Data
- [lightr](https://github.com/ropensci/lightr)*: Read Spectrometric Data and Metadata
- [rromeo](https://github.com/ropensci/rromeo)*: Access Publisher Copyright & Self-Archiving Policies via the 
  'SHERPA/RoMEO' API
- [mcmcensemble](https://github.com/bisaloo/mcmcensemble)*: Ensemble Sampler for Affine-Invariant MCMC
- [contactdata](https://github.com/bisaloo/contactdata): Social Contact Matrices for 152 Countries
- [asymptor](https://github.com/bisaloo/asymptor): Estimate Asymptomatic Cases via Capture/Recapture Methods
- [fundiversity](https://github.com/bisaloo/fundiversity)*: Easy Computation of Alpha Functional Diversity Indices

(* collaborative projects. Please check the full list of authors!)

I'm always super happy to receive feedback about my packages so feel free to get in touch to talk about any problems you encounter, possible improvements, feature requests and just tell me about how you used my packages! I want my projects to be really community projects and not just open-source projects.

But I didn't get started with open-source development with R packages. My initial involvement in a community project was with [HTTPS Everywhere](https://github.com/EFForg/https-everywhere), a browser extension to force HTTPS connection to websites via a manually curated list of rewrite rules. I started as a happy user who wanted to increase the HTTPS coverage provided by the extension. I enjoyed the experience of collaborating to build something great together and continued contributing, until I eventually became one of the main contributors and then a ruleset maintainer.

You can interact with me here on GitHub or on Twitter ([@grusonh](https://twitter.com/grusonh))!
