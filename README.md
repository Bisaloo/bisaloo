### Hello world :wave:

I'm Hugo Gruson. I'm primarily an Evolutionary Biologist but I fell in love with R and package development during my PhD. I am now a Research Software Engineer in Epidemiology and I can enjoy building tools to facilitate research of others.

I'm particularly proud about the following R packages I'm maintaining or I've helped build:

- pavo
- lightr
- rromeo
- mcmcensemble
- contactdata
- asymptor
- fundiversity

I'm always super happy to receive feedback about my packages so feel free to get in touch to talk about any problems you encounter, possible improvements, feature requests and just tell me about how you used my packages! I want my projects to be really community projects and not just open-source projects.

Besides these packages, I like to contribute punctually on many other projects from other developers. I truly love community work and the feeling of getting together to build something great!

You can interact with me here on GitHub or on Twitter!
